Cooperation with third party extensions
=======================================

Docxbuilder supports third party extensions which generate well-formed `docutils document tree`_

However, there are some extensions to generate the tree with their original docutils nodes.
Because Docxbuilder does not support the nodes, the all nodes are ignored when building the document.
If you want to include the extension contents into the document,
you must define the function to handle the node in ``conf.py``.

   :caption: Example to define a method for third party extension

   # Define setup function in conf.py
   def setup(app):
       # Define visit method for plantuml node generated by sphinxcontrib.plantuml
       def docx_visit_plantuml(self, node):
           def get_filepath(self, node):
               from sphinxcontrib import plantuml
               _, filepath = plantuml.render_plantuml(self, node, 'png')
               return filepath
           alt = node.get('alt', (node['uml'], None))
           # Docxbuilder provides useful methods. See Docxbuilder reference.
           self.visit_image_node(node, alt, get_filepath)
       # Add the visit method to Docxbuilder
       import docxbuilder
       translator = docxbuilder.DocxBuilder.default_translator_class
       setattr(translator, 'visit_plantuml', docx_visit_plantuml)
