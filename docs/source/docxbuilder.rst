Getting Started

#. Install docxbuilder::

     pip install docxbuilder

   If you use the math directive in your document, you should install also extra packages::

     pip install docxbuilder[math]

#. Add 'docxbuilder' to ``extensions`` configuration of ``conf.py``::

     extensions = [
         ...,
         'docxbuilder',
         ...
     ]

#. Build the document::

     make docx # or sphinx-build -b docx path/to/source path/to/output

Usage
=====

Docxbuilder defines the below configurations to specify the style file or to
customize the docx document properties.

**docx_documents**
  This value determines how to group the document tree into docx files.
  It must be a list of tuples ``(startdocname, targetname, docproperties, toctree_only)``,
  where the items are:

  *startdocname*
    A string, that is the document name of the docx file master document.
  *targetname*
    A string, that is the file name of the docx file.
  *docproperties*
    A dictionary from a string to a value, that specified the document property.
    The detail is described on :doc:`docprops`.
  *toctree_only*
    If true, the contents of the *startdocname* document is not included in the
    output except the TOC tree.

**docx_style**
  The path to the style file.
  Relative path is taken as relative to the directory including ``conf.py``.
  If set to the empty string, default style files is used.
  Default: empty.
**docx_coverpage**
  If true, a cover page is inserted as the first page from the style file.
  If no cover page is found on the style file, no cover page is inserted.
  Default: ``True``.
**docx_pagebreak_before_section**
  The maximum section level, which a page break is inserted before sections with
  a level is less or equal to. Default: ``0`` (The level of top sections is 1,
  then no page break is inserted).
**docx_pagebreak_before_file**
  The maximum section level, which a page break is inserted before the first
  contents of each file in section level less than or equal to.
**docx_pagebreak_before_table_of_contents**
  The maximum section level, which a page break is inserted before each table of contents in section level less than or equal to.
  Default: ``-1`` (No page break is inserted).
**docx_pagebreak_after_table_of_contents**
  The maximum section level, which a page break is inserted after each table of
  contents in section level less than or equal to.
  Table of contents are inserted on the place corresponding to non-hidden toctrees.
  Default: ``0`` (Page breaks are inserted after the tables before the first section).
**docx_update_fields**
  If true, Office Word will ask to update fields in generated documents when the document is opened.
  This is useful when generated documents references some document properties.
  Default: ``False``.
**docx_hide_section_numbers**
  If true, section numbers will be removed from section titles.
  This is useful when Word header styles are auto-numbered, and the Sphinx toctree
  is numbered. When this is setting is not set to true, headers would have
  double section numbers.
  Default: ``False``.
**docx_hide_subtoctrees**
  If true, any TOC tree that is not in the root document will be hidden from
  the Word output.
  Default: ``False``.
**docx_table_options**
  A dictionary with table layout options.
  The following options are supported.
  These options enable to be overridden by each table options
  (see :ref:`class_based_customization_section`).

  *landscape_columns*
    The minimum number of table columns, which tables with the number of
    columns more than or equal to are allocated on landscape pages.
    If this number is ``0``, no tables are allocated on landscape pages.
    Default: ``0``.
  *in_single_page*
    If true, each table is arranged so as not to be divided into multiple pages as much as possible.
    Default: ``False``.
  *row_splittable*
    If false, a row **shall not** be arranged in multiple pages.
    Default: ``True``.
  *header_in_all_page*
    If true, table headers will be displayed on each page which the table is arranged in.
    If a table has no headers, this option is ignored.
    Default: ``False``.
**docx_style_names**
  A dictionary from a reStructuredText class name to a docx style name.
  The styles will be applied to characters or tables with the corresponding class names.
  The detail is described on :ref:`user_defined_styles_section`.
  Default:: empty.

These configurations can be added to ``conf.py``::

  docx_documents = [
      ('index', 'docxbuilder.docx', {
           'title': 'Docxbuilder documentation',
           'created': 'author'
           'subject': 'Sphinx builder extension',
           'keywords': ['sphinx']
       }, True),
  ]
  docx_style = 'path/to/custom_style.docx'
  docx_pagebreak_before_section = 1

Notes
=====

If the title of a rubiric directive is "Footnotes", Docxbuilder ignores the title as the latex write does
(see `sphinx documents`_).
